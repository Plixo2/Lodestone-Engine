Visual Scripting for Minecraft Forge 1.16.4 
First working release of the engine
Create Java functions and use them in a visual scripting language.
Add the visual script to one or more entities, compile and start. At the moment there are few built-in functions, but they can be added at any time via Java. UI and player nodes will be added later. However, the engine is in alpha and there is no documentation about the visual scripting language or creating an add-on. There are start, stop and tick events and a key event, which shows the code, state and characters. The object node can be used to transfer text or numbers (via Javascript). The blue lines follow the program sequence, similar to Unreal. The gray lines transfer values (numbers, texts or other objects).
